TODO: (Unsure what 1 is referring to. Ask about the .lst file in the src directory)
1. Answer worksheet questions: DONE! Screenshot still needed, and review of question answers as well. 
2. Add worksheet pdf, screenshot, etc here
3. P2a: Screenshot to show the memory bounded by the begin and end coremarks. Highlight memory for the variable W. Provide the value of the data associated with the W variable.
4. P2b: Screenshot the memory (byte order) bounded by the begin and end coremarks. Highlight memory for the two variables B and W. Identify the values of the B and W variable in hex. Explain what the .org assembler directive does.
5. P3: Screenshot to show the memory (byte order) bounded by the begin and end coremarks. Highlight memory for the three variables A, B and C. Identify the data associated with the A, B and C variables in hex.
